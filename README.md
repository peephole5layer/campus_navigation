# 🎓Campus Navigator

 Campus Navigator is a smart, interactive web application designed to help students and visitors find the shortest and most efficient path within a university campus. Unlike general-purpose navigation tools like Google Maps, this system is tailored specifically for campus environments, including **indoor navigation** between rooms and buildings.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Outdoor navigation across campus using interactive maps
- 🧭 Indoor navigation between rooms/floors/buildings
- 🔍 Voice-based source & destination selection
- 📍 Custom route drawing using Leaflet.js & OpenStreetMap
- 📊 Backend powered by Spring Boot + MySQL
- 📌 Location-based suggestions for destinations
- 💡 Highlights key infrastructure (labs, libraries, hostels, cafeterias)
